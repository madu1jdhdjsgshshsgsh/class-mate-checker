Required Arduino Libraries for Attendance System
================================================

Install these libraries through Arduino IDE Library Manager:

1. WiFi (Built-in with Arduino Uno R4 WiFi)
   - For WiFi connectivity

2. HTTPClient (Built-in with Arduino Uno R4 WiFi)
   - For making HTTP requests to Supabase

3. ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
   - For JSON parsing and creation
   - Version: 6.x.x recommended

4. MFRC522 by GithubCommunity
   - For RFID reader communication
   - Works with RC522 RFID modules

5. TinyGPS++ by Mikal Hart
   - For GPS data parsing
   - Version: 1.x.x recommended

6. SoftwareSerial (Built-in)
   - For GPS module communication

Hardware Connections:
====================

RFID RC522 Module:
- VCC -> 3.3V
- RST -> Pin 9
- GND -> GND
- MISO -> Pin 12
- MOSI -> Pin 11
- SCK -> Pin 13
- SS/SDA -> Pin 10

GPS Module (NEO-6M/NEO-8M):
- VCC -> 5V
- GND -> GND
- TX -> Pin 4 (Arduino RX)
- RX -> Pin 5 (Arduino TX)

LEDs and Buzzer:
- Green LED -> Pin 7 + 220Ω resistor -> GND
- Red LED -> Pin 6 + 220Ω resistor -> GND  
- Buzzer -> Pin 8 -> GND

Configuration Steps:
===================

1. Update WiFi credentials in the code:
   - Replace "YOUR_WIFI_SSID" with your network name
   - Replace "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD" with your password

2. Set unique device ID:
   - Change "arduino_uno_r4_001" to a unique identifier

3. Test GPS module separately first to ensure it gets satellite fix

4. Upload code and monitor Serial output at 115200 baud

Serial Commands for Testing:
===========================

Type these in Serial Monitor:
- "status" - Shows system status
- "test" - Sends test RFID data
- "gps" - Shows current GPS coordinates

Troubleshooting:
===============

- If GPS doesn't get fix: Move to area with clear sky view
- If WiFi won't connect: Check credentials and signal strength
- If RFID not detected: Check wiring and card compatibility
- If HTTP requests fail: Check internet connection and endpoint URLs
